# 8-Bit Computer Project

## Description
This project involves the design and simulation of an 8-bit computer system using ModelSim and Quartus. The system features:
- 128 bytes of program memory (ROM)
- 96 bytes of data memory (read/write)
- 16 output ports and 16 input ports
- An instruction set capable of executing operations such as data manipulation, loading, storing, and branching, totaling 45 instructions
- Two 8-bit buses and two 8-bit general-purpose registers for data transfer and storage
- Verification of instructions is performed through simulation.

## Reference
This project is based on concepts presented in "Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with VHDL" by Brock J. LaMeres.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Quartus and ModelSim.
3. Review the design files and test benches to understand the system architecture and behavior.
4. Run simulations to verify the functionality of the 8-bit computer system.
5. Modify and extend the design as needed for your specific requirements.
